# Introduction #

When creating our new website, we faced many important questions. After all, this is going to define how most people will view our business! Should we use an existing content management system (CMS)?  Build everything from from ground up? Hire a third party to do the work? Yeah, ok, scratch that last one.

In fact, since the very beginning we wanted to take this opportunity to give back to the community. What better way than by open sourcing our development process, showcasing the capabilities of Gwt-Platform, the GWT framework we created and that is now being used on dozens of projects around the world.

Well from now on, we'll give you links to every post related to Hive we do on our Developer blog and hope it'll help you with your own projects.
