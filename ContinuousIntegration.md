# Continuous Integration #

GWTP uses a continuous integration server located at [Teamcity](http://teamcity.codebetter.com/project.html?projectId=project92). This server compiles GWTP and all the samples, runs the tests, and packages snapshot jars.

Contributors are encouraged to monitor the continuous integration server, especially after they commit to the trunk. Automatic email notifications can easily be configured.
