# Introduction #

Using [UIBinder internationalisation features](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideUiBinderI18n.html) can be difficult. This has been discussed extensively on GWT [Issue 4355](http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=4355).

# Solution #

To overcome this problem, GWTP makes it easy for you to store all your translations in:
  * `src/com/google/gwt/i18n/client/LocalizableResource.properties`
  * `src/com/google/gwt/i18n/client/LocalizableResource_fr.properties`
  * etc.

However, it is still necessary to keep all these files synchronized with one another. In addition, you want to make sure they contain any message included in a UIBinder xml file. To do so, GWTP lets you use the python script `mergelocales.py`. The script can be found in the [Downloads section](http://code.google.com/p/gwt-platform/downloads/list).

The exact process is as follows:
  * Compile GWT code by adding parameter `-extra extras`
  * Run `mergelocales extras/YourProjectName src/com/google/gwt/i18n/client/`
  * Go through the `LocalizableResource_xxxx.properties` files and solve the TODO comments.

For more details on the script, run `mergelocales --help`.

# Additional information #

GWT looks for the `LocalizableResource???.properties` files in the
directory of your class implementing Constants or Messages, and in
the directory of any super interfaces. The problem with `UiBinder`
translations is that the associated `LocalizableResource` files are
generated in the folder of the `UiBinder` file, so your resources are
spread across your directories. mergelocale looks for all of these and
merge them intelligently in a central location: com.google.gwt.i18n.client. This is legit since this package is the
directory of the `LocalizableResource`, a superinterface common to both
Constants and Messages.

When compiling a localized GWT project, one has to
  1. compile 1st time, to generate extras locales
  1. run mergelocale and update translations
  1. compile 2nd time, so translations are included in the results
