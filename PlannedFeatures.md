In time GWTP will offer you a number of extra features. Don't worry, though, GWTP will not grow into a bloated framework! Only really useful features make it into the platform. And remember, thanks to GWT's optimized compilation, features you're not using are never added to your application, so it will always load lightning fast!

The following list shows these upcoming features, with a link to the related issue in the tracker, in case you want to 'star' it and show your interest:
  * **DONE!** Integration with Google Analytics ([Issue 42](http://code.google.com/p/gwt-platform/issues/detail?id=42))
