# Introduction #

The GWTP annotation-based automatic proxies will work in almost every situations, but in very rare cases you may have specific needs that are not currently supported by annotations. In these cases, it might be useful to code your own custom `Proxy` class.

Before you start implementing your own custom proxy, you should try to use the `@ProxyEvent` annotation to solve your problem. This annotation is described in more details [here](http://code.google.com/p/gwt-platform/wiki/GettingStarted#Using_custom_events).

Before we start, here is a useful trick. If you want to see the proxy classes generated by GWTP, use the GWT compiler `-gen extras` flag when compiling your application. All the generated proxy classes will then be found under the `extras` folder.

# Custom Proxy that is also a Place #

The following example shows you how to build a basic custom proxy that is also a place. This example uses code splitting, if you don't want this replace `AsyncProvider` with `Provider` and `CodeSplitProvider` with `StandardProvider`.

```
public class MyPresenterProxyPlaceImpl extends ProxyPlace<MyPresenter> 
implements MyPresenter.MyProxy {
  
  public static class WrappedProxy extends ProxyImpl<MyPresenter> {
    @Inject
    public WrappedProxy( AsyncProvider<MyPresenter> presenter ) {
      this.presenter = new CodeSplitProvider<MyPresenter>(presenter);
    }    
  }
  
  @Inject
  public MainPagePresenterMyProxyImpl( WrappedProxy proxy ) {
    this.proxy = proxy;
    place = new PlaceImpl( "myToken" );
  }
}
```
